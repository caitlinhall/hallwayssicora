                    <p>After a completely awkward chit chat about which path to go down, we decided to go right. In other words, we decided to go on a date. Anthony took Caitlin to the Chatter Box where we played a fun game of Connect Four. Caitlin knocked down all her chips which flew everywhere. To make Caitlin feel better, Anthony did the same. What a good guy.</p>

                    <p>We went to Tulum, Mexico also known as the Walled City. Tulum stands on a bluff facing towards the Caribbean Sea. The ruins have three walls creating a fort. We walked through the city and came to one of the walls and walked out to get a better view of the sea. The planned cue was for Anthony to ask Tim to take a picture of us. Tim the most awesome little brother suggested to Anthony “Hey Anthony, you want a picture here.” Anthony agreed this was a good spot for a photo. We took a picture and Caitlin was off to the next part. Anthony grabbed her hand and said “wait a second I got a question for you.” Caitlin in confusion and lack of patience said “no you don’t” and started to walk away. Anthony proclaimed he was serious and got down on one knee. Caitlin in utter shock stood there and squealed yes, but would not remove her hands from her mouth. Anthony asked “well can I have that hand to put the ring on.” Caitlin then said “yes of course” with a giant smile. </p>
